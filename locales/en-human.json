    },

      "Q": "How do I buy or sell bitcoin?",

    },
    "HOW_DO_I_BUY_OR_SELL_UNSUPPORTED_CURRS": {
      "Q": "How do I buy ether or Bitcoin Cash?",
      "A": "We’re working on that! In the meantime, you can exchange bitcoin for ether or Bitcoin Cash in the <a>{{ ::text }}</a> of your wallet."

      "A": "We’re working on that! In the meantime, you can exchange between bitcoin, ether, and Bitcoin Cash in the <a>{{ ::text }}</a> of your wallet."
    },
    "WALLET_SAFETY": {
      "Q": "What do I need to do to keep my wallet safe?",
      "A": "Our Security Center can help you keep your wallet secure and ensure that you can access your funds even if you lose your password - all in less than 5 minutes. A great place to start is to enable 2-Step Verification to help prevent unauthorized access to your wallet and write down your Recovery Phrase to make sure you never lose access to your funds. We also recommend using a unique, random password that’s at least 16 characters or more."
    },
    "WALLET_ID_VS_ADDRESS": {
      "Q": "What is the difference between a wallet ID and an address?",
      "A": "You can think of your wallet ID as a username that contains numbers, letters, and dashes. It is only used to log into your wallet and should be kept private. Your wallet ID can be found in the welcome email we sent you when you created your wallet or in Settings -> General. Addresses are what you share with others when you want to receive funds. To find your bitcoin, ether, or Bitcoin Cash address click on Request."
    },
    "HOW_TO_TRANSACT": {
      "Q": "How do I receive/send funds?",
      "A": "To receive funds, the sender needs your address. Your wallet will automatically generate a new address for each bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash transaction you make. For all ether transactions, your address will remain the same. Click on ‘Request’, select the currency you’d like to receive from the dropdown, and copy the address to share with the sender. To send funds, click ‘Send’, select the currency you want to send from the dropdown, and enter the recipient’s address in the ‘To’ field and how much you want to send."
    },
    "HOW_MUCH_TO_SEND": {
      "Q": "How much does it cost to send funds?",
      "A": "While our wallet is entirely free to use, the small fee included in your transaction goes to the miners, who help power the flow of transactions on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash networks. To ensure your transactions confirm consistently and reliably, your wallet will automatically include an appropriate fee based on your transaction’s size and the level of network traffic at the time. If you wish to specify your own fee for bitcoin transactions, you can do so under 'Customize Fee."
    },
    "WHEN_IS_A_TX_CONFIRMED": {
      "Q": "How do I know if a transaction has been successfully received/sent?",
      "A": "Transactions will appear almost instantly in your transaction feed which you can find by clicking on the corresponding currency on the left navigation of your wallet. While your bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash transactions are considered complete once they have 3 network confirmations, your ether transactions will be considered complete after 12 confirmations. This typically takes about 30 minutes for bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash and 5 minutes for ether, but can vary. Until then your transaction will show up as pending."
    },
    "CAN_BC_SEE_FUNDS": {
      "Q": "Can Blockchain see or access my funds?",
      "A": "We are a noncustodial wallet and therefore do not have access to your funds. This means we cannot view your balances, make payments on your behalf, or prevent you from accessing your wallet. With your Blockchain wallet, you retain complete ownership of your funds."
    },
    "CAN_BC_RESET_PW": {
      "Q": "Can Blockchain reset my password?",
      "A": "At Blockchain, we’re committed to letting customers maintain full control of their funds. In that spirit, we never see or store your password, so we can’t reset it for you. However, we do provide users a backup phrase that can be used to restore access to your funds. Head over to your <a>{{::text | translate}}</a> to find yours. Make sure you store it somewhere secure and never share it."
